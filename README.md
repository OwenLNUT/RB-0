# RB-0
RB-0 is a hobby sized rover that uses the same suspension method as NASA's newe differential bar rovers. It uses a Jetson Nano, a camera, 15 servos, a Circuit Playground Express, and Wi-Fi for fun with manuevering and running AI. It can climb small obstacles, move its camera in different directions, and steer all 6 wheels. I wanted to make it open source so anyone can have fun and learn from it!
